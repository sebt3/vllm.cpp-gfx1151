# Features <!-- ENG-RELEASE-WINDOWS: state=ACTIVE publication=pending artifact=unpublished -->

What vllm.cpp supports, next to the engines it is measured against. This page is
a **keyed table**: one row per feature, kept current. It is not a changelog.

For measured speed see [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md); for per-capability
lifecycle state and the caveats behind each row see [STATUS.md](STATUS.md); for
the agent-facing parity inventory with upstream file references see
[.agents/feature-matrix.md](../.agents/feature-matrix.md).

**Legend.** ✅ supported and gated. ◐ partial, usable with named gaps. ☐ not yet.
n/a means the feature does not apply to that engine's design.

Reference versions: vLLM 0.26.0.dev0, SGLang v0.5.15, llama.cpp `b10451`,
MLX-LM as of 2026-07. Competitor columns describe what those projects ship, and
are our reading of their documented behavior, not measurements.

## Serving and scheduling

| Feature | vllm.cpp | vLLM | SGLang | llama.cpp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Continuous batching | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ |
| Chunked prefill | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Automatic prefix caching | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (radix) | ◐ |
| Preemption and recompute | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |

| LPM cache-aware admission | ✅ | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| In-batch prefix de-prioritization | ✅ | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Async / overlap scheduling | ✅ default on (UAF-safe drain; device token-ids mirror on gate + classic-dense; the decode graph declines while the mirror is live (#323 fix, eager fallback); opt-in `VT_ASYNC_EXECUTOR` out-of-capture H2D staging) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |

| Compute directly on quantized blocks | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ | ✅ |

| Memory cap with a pre-flight error instead of an OOM | ☐ | ◐ KV pool only | ◐ | ☐ |
| Routed-expert weight streaming from disk | ◐ default OFF (`VT_MOE_EXPERT_STREAM=1`), keep-quant/keep-f16 towers (#1378); bounded slot cache; refuses unfittable slices by name. c1-c4 capacity, not throughput. CPU; staging device DECODES, token gate FAILS (#1299) | ☐ blanket `cpu_offload_gb`, not expert-granular | ☐ | ◐ mmap only |

## Quantization and weight formats

| Format | vllm.cpp | vLLM | SGLang | llama.cpp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NVFP4 (W4A4 and W4A16 Marlin) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ in GGUF, not safetensors (#979). Was wrongly ☐: `GGML_TYPE_NVFP4 = 40` (`ggml.h:430`), CUDA MMQ and the ModelOpt repacking converter are UPSTREAM at pin `b10451`, the sm_121a GEMMs fork-local |
| NVFP4 dense sinks take vLLM's dense Marlin, not the single-expert MoE route | ✅ `VT_MARLIN_DENSE` (single projection, `efa6e40d`) + `VT_MARLIN_DENSE_PAIR` (fused shared-expert gate_up), both default-ON; the pair sink measured +1.31% at c8 / +1.38% at c4 on 35B-A3B, SACRED 315/315 + 235/235 | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Dense W4A16 MLP runs ONE merged `gate_up` Marlin GEMM (vLLM's `MergedColumnParallelLinear` topology) | ✅ `VT_DENSE_MARLIN_GATEUP`, **default ON** (opt out `=0`): the A/B measured +2.12% c1 / +1.70% c8 on the 27B, arms separated, tokens identical (#365). Replaces the split pair's 193 Marlin calls/step vs the oracle's 129 | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| NVFP4 shared-expert `down_proj` kept bf16 (no f32 round-trip) | ✅ `VT_SHARED_DOWN_BF16` default-ON; bit-identical (both consumers widen bf16 in-kernel and re-round on store), SACRED 315/315 + 235/235 on BOTH arms with unchanged assertion counts; +2.05% c8 / +0.79% c4 on 35B-A3B | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| NVFP4 `lm_head` kept packed (no dequant at load) | ✅ `VT_LMHEAD_FP4` default-ON, #213; CUDA-gated on `nvidia`@`0893e160` (continuations byte-identical packed vs dequant, 235/235; RSS -1.70 GiB on CUDA, owed a re-measure; a no-fp4-GEMM backend keeps one bf16 operand too) | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| GGUF k-quants and i-quants | ✅ (CPU grouped keep-quant MoE bf16 regression in `b4f5610a` fixed 2026-08-06). **CPU quant compute is ISA-tiered:** Arm has i8mm + repack; x86_64 portable-only, MEASURED open on every axis (CIQ `G5`, #433) | ☐ | ☐ | ✅ |
| GGUF F16 weights kept resident as F16 (no BF16 promotion) | ✅ `VT_GGUF_KEEP_F16` default-ON (CPU), the f16 GEMM computes on it directly. Default settled 2026-08-17, a memory-for-speed trade: 1.05 GiB less peak RSS for ~9% prefill and ~1.4% decode, tokens identical. `0` opts out | ☐ | ☐ | ✅ `ggml_vec_dot_f16` |
| GGUF is a TWO-engine comparison at these pins (#979) | ✅ text-only `qwen35`, no `clip` projector (#821) | ☐ REMOVED from the tree in `6635279d8`, now an unpinned out-of-tree `vllm-gguf-plugin` | ☐ full stack present, `qwen3_5` unreachable behind FOUR blockers, and the load path has NO completeness guard so a clean-looking load proves nothing | ✅ native, `LLM_ARCH_QWEN35` |
| AWQ | ◐ CPU dequant | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| GPTQ | ◐ CPU dequant | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| MXFP4 compressed-tensors | ◐ W4A16 Marlin, mem 2.63x less. gate_up FUSION + decode-graph default-ON; #44 3/3, 32B 6/6. **`VT_MARLIN_DENSE` DEFAULT-ON** (`KERNEL-MARLIN-DENSE-EXEC`): dense marlin 48-CTA, byte-faithful, beats MoE (c8 0.969) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Compressed-tensors `mixed-precision` (`config_groups`, ordered regex `targets`) | ◐ scheme read from the config, never from a dtype probe; an arm with no loader is REFUSED BY NAME. On `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4` the W4A4 group loads, the FP8 W8A8 group and the `kv_cache_scheme` are refused (#821) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| fp8 weights, per-tensor scale | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Block-wise (fine-grained 128x128) FP8, the `weight_scale_inv` layout | ◐ RUNS on CPU (#1189 M4/M6): 10 projections as 7 GEMMs, `gate_up`+QKV merged. CUDA sm120: N,K %128==0 only; 7 shapes MATCH CPU ref on GB10, no token gate (#1437) ([spec](../.agents/specs/vt-matmul-fp8-block-cuda.md)) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Per-tensor FP8 W8A8 linear is a shared seam any model can bind | ✅ `models/dense_fp8_gemm.h` + `layers::Fp8W8A8LinearMethod` (#940), bound via `layers::MakeLinearMethod`. One definition, CUDA only ([spec](../.agents/specs/vt-fp8-shared-seam.md)) | ✅ `Fp8LinearMethod` | ✅ | ☐ |
| FP8 W8A8 works on a CUDA arch without `cutlass-fp8` | ✅ `vt::QuantFp8Static` registers from an unconditional TU (#960); sm_110 measured ([spec](../.agents/specs/vt-fp8-quant-arch-gate.md)) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| fp8-tower GDN `in_proj` emits bf16, unlocking packed GDN decode | ◐ `VT_GDN_FP8_IN_BF16` + `VT_GDN_PACKED_DECODE_FP8_TOWER` (inert alone), both default **OFF**, ungated (#339) ([spec](../.agents/specs/perf-fp8-alpha-fold.md)) | ✅ bf16 `out_dtype` | ☐ | ☐ |
| Merged fp8 projection folds per-column alpha in the GEMM epilogue | ◐ `VT_FP8_ALPHA_VEC_EPILOGUE`, CUDA only, default off, ungated; refuses split-K under a bf16-D equivalence claim (`claims_splitk1_premise`, default off) | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| `vt::MulColVecF32` carries a bf16 store width | ✅ f32 arm byte-identical; bf16 arm rounds once; CPU + CUDA | n/a | ☐ | ☐ |
| bf16 / fp16 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Safetensors direct load, no conversion | ✅ at ANY tensor byte offset: the format aligns nothing, so no loader forms a typed pointer into the mapping. Last three fixed by #772; a checker is still owed on #627 | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Weights uploaded straight from the file mapping (no host copy first) | ◐ verbatim tensors only (37.8% of 27B BF16); arbitrary-offset reads are defined, including Laguna graph staging. Merged/transposed and merged FP4 weights still copy | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ mmap |

## Model coverage

The supported set is exactly what the C++ registry registers: every
architecture self-registers via `REGISTER_VLLM_MODEL`, and
`scripts/check-supported-models.py` gates this list against the source so it
cannot drift. Today that is **40 registered architectures**. Each row names the
checkpoint it was gated against and the verdict; caveats are in
[STATUS.md](STATUS.md), agent detail in `.agents/model-matrix.md`. A mergeable
gate/up MLP routes through one shared merged-GEMM method, so a tuned arm added
once reaches every such arch; Command-R, GLM-4, MiniCPM, MiniCPM3 and Phi-3
joined on 2026-08-10 (#299), and
`scripts/merged-gemm-consistency-allowlist.txt` lists the rest with their
blocker.

Gate words: **strict** is token-for-token identical to the vLLM oracle;
**near-tie** is the ratified distributional gate used where vLLM's own greedy is
bf16-non-deterministic; **scaffold** means registered and config/loader-gated
but the forward is not yet a real-checkpoint run. Speed is a separate bar (match
or beat the reference on every axis); most rows are correctness-complete and
speed-pending, which [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) tracks.

### Standalone and non-registered lanes

These run through dedicated forwards, not the `REGISTER_VLLM_MODEL` registry, so
they sit outside the gated list above. One caveat the LTX-2.5 row is too narrow
to carry: its text tower's prompt tokenization mirrors upstream only while the
checkpoint's tokenizer `post_processor` adds nothing. The shipped one is MEASURED
empty, so this port's plain encode plus an explicit BOS prepend matches
upstream's `add_special_tokens=True` today; a checkpoint with a non-empty
`post_processor` would tokenize differently here, and `Ltx2TokenizeGemmaPrompt`
in `ltx2_text_encoder.cpp` is the call that would have to change.

### Inventoried but blocked

Enumerated in `.agents/model-matrix.md`, not registered, no runnable GB10 gate:

|---|---|---|
| `DeepseekV3ForCausalLM`, `DeepseekV32ForCausalLM` | DeepSeek-V3 / V3.2 | 671B, ~642 GiB fp8 vs 119 GiB unified; V3.2 also DSA-indexer dep-blocked |
| `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM` | GLM-5 (DSA) | ~1404 GiB bf16; dep-blocked (GLM-5.x is DeepSeek-V3.2 verbatim) |

No oracle runs here: ~290 GB fp8 vs a 122 GiB ceiling, so NO speed number is claimable ([spec](../.agents/specs/dots3-note.md), #699) |

27 of the 36 registered text-generation architectures carry a passing
correctness gate today; the rest are honestly marked scaffold or blocked above.
(The 40 registered total also covers 3 Parakeet ASR entry points and the
`LlamaModel` embedding arch, which are not text generation.)
vLLM registers 130+ text architectures, so this is a curated, gated subset, not
a breadth claim. The first EMBEDDING architecture is registered and live
(`LlamaModel`, task=embed, LAST pooling, the as_embedding_model mirror, gated
on the committed fixture); reranking/classify models are not yet registered.

## Multimodal

| Input | vllm.cpp | vLLM | SGLang | llama.cpp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Image | ✅ correctness-gated | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ |
| Video | ✅ correctness-gated | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Audio | ✅ correctness-gated | ✅ | ◐ | ◐ |
| Video+audio GENERATION (MiniMax-H3 DiT, LTX-2.5 DiT) | ◐ H3: all three modalities COHERENT on Q4_K_M (t2va, fl2va, ref2va; §8.20); the NVFP4 arm carries the patch grid; GGUF/NVFP4/bf16 loaders, pruned too (§8.21). LTX-2.5: a second lane, `SPIKE`, gated at reduced dims | ✅ H3 (vllm-omni, BF16-only, no quantized arm); LTX-2.5 only through the generic diffusers adapter, no native recipe ([vllm-omni#6066](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/issues/6066)) | ☐ | ☐ |
| Speech / audio GENERATION (TTS, vLLM-Omni lane) | ◐ IndexTTS-2.5: vllm_synthesize renders TEXT to AUDIO on real weights, but the reference clip is IGNORED and CAMPPlus returns NaN on real weights (#634, #633) | ✅ (vllm-omni: MOSS-TTS, Qwen3-TTS, Higgs Audio v3, Voxtral TTS, IndexTTS-2.5) | not assessed | not assessed |
| MUSIC generation (MiniMax-Music3) | ✓ every stage gated; an HTTP request observed e2e over a REAL SOCKET against a MUSIC-ONLY server (#852, #672, [spec](../.agents/specs/minimax-music3.md) §10); adjacent caption italics match upstream (#1083) | ☐ absent from the pin, from vLLM `main` and from `vllm-omni` | ◐ SGLang-Omni serves the NATIVE layout; its 32 kHz resample and batching are OWED | ☐ |
| Multimodal over the OpenAI server | ◐ image request path wired, forward pending | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ |

Image, video and audio are correct through the CLI and library. Over the HTTP
API the image **request** path is wired end to end (`ROAD-V1-MM` W1-W3): the
production server attaches the seam at `server_main.cpp:826`. Two residuals keep
it from ✅: the model runner has no mm-forward consuming `Request.mm_features`,
and no image codec is vendored (raw RGB only). Video, audio and multi-image over
HTTP are not started. Audio **in** is gated. Audio **out** has a surface now
(`/v1/audio/speech`, `vllm_speech_*` v20), but no family renders from a prompt:
both refuse, naming what is missing.

## Speculative decoding

CUDA runtime-verified on GB10 (sm_121a), Jetson Thor (sm_110) and Jetson AGX
Orin (sm_87). sm_110 has no CUTLASS FP4 tensor-core kernels and no `fp4-mma`,
so it stays a correctness venue for those; the one fast path it does get is the
vendored **Marlin NVFP4 W4A16** GEMM, enabled since 2026-08-11 and validated on
Thor silicon (8.0x-29.0x per GEMM at M=1, e2e 16.61 to 81.63 tok/s at c=1 on
Qwen3-1.7B-NVFP4A16). That is a kernel-level result, not a token-exact
model-level gate.

Vulkan **runs a model end to end**: `opt-125m` greedy is STRICT token-exact,
6/6 prompts vs the vLLM 0.25.0 oracle, every op dispatched natively with **zero
provider declines**. Qwen3.6-27B runs too, both GDN recurrences and the fused
attention preamble native: **decode 4.36 tok/s vs llama.cpp's 4.35, parity met
narrowly**, denominator SUPERSEDED (#1003), and prefill **21.5x**, a SELF-ratio
(GB10). A load keeps **one** copy of the weights, not two, and is 1.54x faster
warm: 27B peak RSS 100.8 -> **53.4 GiB**. Still partial at 25 natively
registered ops of 112 (8 GDN), the rest on the portable CPU tier; quant/MoE/MLA
have none.
Build with `-DVLLM_CPP_VULKAN=ON`; off by default.

#### C-ABI capability coverage <!-- abi-capability-table:begin -->
- Which capabilities an embedder drives through the flat C ABI (`include/vllm.h`, the only installed header), gated by `scripts/check-surface-coverage.py`: a `reachable` row names an entry point that exists; an `embedder-unreachable` row is tracked in `scripts/abi-capability-allowlist.txt` against its fold row (`ARCH-ONE-SURFACE`). The ABI is text-generation-complete; the one `embedder-unreachable` row (multimodal input) is the open capability gap.

## Parallelism and scale-out

Single-GPU today. Every mode below is scoped against one `vt::Communicator`
abstraction, and `world_size == 1` stays byte-identical.

CPU elementwise GEMM (f32/f16/bf16) runs AVX2 and AVX-512 tiers on x86 where the CPU supports them (SSE2 before), selected by a runtime probe, and can take a transpose-free `[K,N]` weight path via an opt-in load-time repack (`VT_CPU_ELEM_KN_REPACK`, CPU only, default off). Byte-identical to the portable tier either way.

| LTX-2.5 resolution | Off-grid sizes refused, naming the offending axis and a size you can actually pass; frames still round | `--width`/`--height` must divide 64 (two-stage) or 32 (one-stage), from the VAE factor times the phase downscale ([#919](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/919)). `--frames` rounds to `8k + 1`. No size cap |
| LTX-2.5 arms nothing can request | Declared, not requestable | `int8-convrot` (ComfyUI-only), single-node multi-GPU, `BetaScheduler` (upstream selects no scheduler either). No flag or extra asks for these. `multishot` was RETIRED (absent upstream) and `kLoraFusion` too (now served) |
| Qwen3.8-27B quantized arms (Q4_K_M GGUF, its `clip` mmproj, the `unsloth` "NVFP4" = `mixed-precision`) | All three files ACCOUNTED against committed manifests (866 / 334 / 1968 names), none RUN: no token gate, Q4_K_M PENDING on #857 | BF16 gated (#915). `--mmproj` (ABI v22) loads a `clip` GGUF; a load refuses a file with a tensor no loader reads. "NVFP4" @`7d6f8d4d`: W4A4 loads, FP8 refused ([spec](../.agents/specs/qwen38-27b-quant-arms.md)) |
| Multi-GPU execution | Hardware-blocked | TP proven equal to tp=1 on CPU; no 2-GPU box to run it |
| LoRA end to end | CPU brick landed | Unwired standalone; not usable through the server |
| Multimodal over HTTP | Image request path wired; forward + codec pending | `ROAD-V1-MM` W1-W3 landed. Open: no mm-forward on `Request.mm_features`; no image codec. Video/audio/multi-image now **refuse** with HTTP 400 rather than drop ([#686](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/686)) |
| Reranking / classify models | Engine side only | Embeddings are LIVE (`LlamaModel`, `vllm_embed`, `/v1/embeddings`); the classify/score heads are landed ops with no registered arch |
| ROCm | W0 community-verified on 5 gfx archs; classic-dense and GDN-hybrid e2e run all-native; correctness gaps remain | 47 registered ops including the GDN state/conv/postconv/recurrence set and MoE combine/gate; APU managed-allocation branch remains unverified. [ROCM.md](ROCM.md) |
| XPU, TPU | Not started | CUDA, CPU, Metal and Vulkan are the built backends |
| Custom logits processors on CUDA | Open, not root-caused | Segfaults in a CUDA build, 232/232 green on CPU |
| Memory budgeting (`ROAD-V1-MEM`, #83) | M1+M2 landed (absolute bytes) | `--kv-cache-memory` sizes the KV pool from an absolute byte budget (ABI v16, group-aware divisor); `--num-blocks` overrides; `--gpu-memory-utilization` needs the M3 profile run (dgx-gated). See `specs/kv-sizing.md` |

## How to read this page

A ✅ means the feature is implemented **and** carries a gate: for model rows that
is a token-for-token comparison against the pinned vLLM oracle on the same
workload, and for engine rows it is a named test in the tree. A ◐ means the code
path exists and works within stated limits, and the limits are named in
[STATUS.md](STATUS.md) rather than glossed. We do not mark a row ✅ because the
code compiles, and we do not mark a competitor ☐ to flatter a column.

Feature parity is not the same as speed parity. Most architectures here are
correctness-complete and speed-pending, and [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) says
which is which.

The marks track implementation and gates, not who is working on something. The
2026-08-04 claim triage moved 58 agent-record rows out of `ACTIVE` because
nobody is flying them; the 2026-08-05 device inventory put 11 llama.cpp ggml
backends in scope as inventoried rows. Neither changed a capability, so **no
mark on this page moved**. An inventoried backend is not a supported one, and the same
holds for the 31 architectures inventoried on 2026-08-05. A row's lifecycle state and its support mark
are independent: see [STATUS.md](STATUS.md). Parakeet ASR (encoder + CTC/RNN-T/TDT) runs natively on CPU, 4 checkpoints token-exact vs HF.
